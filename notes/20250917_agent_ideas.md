# Agent Ideas for PorscheTrends Development
Date: September 17, 2025

## Overview
These are agent tasks that can be launched to autonomously handle complex development work on the PorscheTrends project. Agents can work independently and report back with results.

## Data Collection & Scraping Agents

### 1. **Broken Scraper Recovery Agent**
```
"Launch a general-purpose agent to analyze why Classic.com, Edmunds, Cars.com, and CarsAndBids scrapers are failing. Test each scraper individually, identify the root causes (robots.txt, changed HTML structure, authentication requirements), and implement fixes. Test the fixes and report back with success rates."
```

### 2. **New Data Source Integration Agent**
```
"Launch an agent to research and implement scrapers for new data sources: Hemmings, Collecting Cars, PCARMARKET, and Rennlist. Create scrapers following the BaseScraper pattern, test them thoroughly, and add them to the scrape-and-save.ts workflow."
```

### 3. **VIN Data Enrichment Agent**
```
"Launch an agent to find all listings missing VINs, analyze the stored HTML for VIN patterns we might have missed, implement improved VIN extraction logic, and backfill the database with found VINs."
```

## Data Quality & Analytics Agents

### 4. **Data Quality Audit Agent**
```
"Launch an agent to audit our entire database for data quality issues: identify missing required fields (VIN, mileage, color), find price outliers, detect duplicate listings with different URLs, and create fix scripts for each issue type."
```

### 5. **Historical Price Tracking Agent**
```
"Launch an agent to design and implement a proper historical price tracking system. Create a new 'price_history' table, implement daily snapshots of listing prices, and modify the analytics API to use real historical data for sparklines."
```

### 6. **Options Normalization Agent**
```
"Launch an agent to analyze all options_text data, identify common patterns and variations, expand our options normalization mapping, and create a comprehensive options extraction system that properly populates the listing_options relational table."
```

### 7. **Market Trend Analysis Agent**
```
"Launch an agent to implement advanced market analytics: calculate true appreciation/depreciation rates by model/trim, identify seasonal pricing patterns, detect market anomalies, and create new API endpoints for these insights."
```

## Performance & Infrastructure Agents

### 8. **Database Performance Optimization Agent**
```
"Launch an agent to analyze all Supabase queries in the codebase, identify N+1 queries and inefficient patterns, add proper indexes to the database, implement query caching where appropriate, and optimize the slowest pages."

### 12. **Comparison Tool Agent**
```
"Launch an agent to build a model/trim comparison feature. Create a UI to select multiple trims, display side-by-side statistics, show price and volume trends, and highlight key differences. Add a shareable comparison URL feature."
```

### 13. **Price Alert System Agent**
```
"Launch an agent to implement a price alert system. Design the database schema for user alerts, create UI for setting alerts on specific model/trim combinations, implement background job to check alerts, and add email notification system."

```

## Testing & Documentation Agents

### 15. **Test Coverage Agent**
```
"Launch an agent to implement comprehensive testing. Write unit tests for all scraper parsers, create integration tests for API endpoints, add E2E tests for critical user flows, and set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions."
```

### 16. **API Documentation Agent**

2. Price normalization agent  
3. Mileage validation agent
4. Color standardization agent
5. Options parsing agent
Each focusing on their specific data quality aspect."
```

## Usage Notes
- Agents work best with clear, specific objectives
- Always specify what the agent should report back
- For complex tasks, break them down into multiple focused agents
- Agents can work in parallel for faster development
- Each agent invocation is stateless - provide all context needed
