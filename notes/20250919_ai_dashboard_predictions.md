# AI-Powered Dashboard Predictions Implementation
**Date:** September 19, 2025

## Context
The insights page was transformed from a blog-like text layout into a proper analytics dashboard with charts. However, we needed the market-insights workflow to generate AI-powered predictions and complex analytics data for these charts, not just text insights.

## What We Built

### 1. Dashboard Transformation (Completed)
- Removed all fake data generation (Math.random() calls)
- Created new dashboard components:
  - `MetricsDashboard`: KPI cards with trend indicators
  - `TimeRangeSelector`: Interactive time range filter
  - `DashboardGrid`: Responsive layout system
  - `ModelComparisonChart`: Bar charts for model comparison
  - `PriceVsMileageScatter`: Scatter plot for depreciation analysis
  - `VolumeAnalysisChart`: Area/Line charts for volume trends
- Created `/api/analytics/dashboard` endpoint that aggregates real data
- Dashboard now filters by `sold_date` (when cars actually sold) not `scraped_at`

### 2. AI Predictions System (New)
Created infrastructure for AI-powered chart predictions:

#### Script: `scripts/analytics/generate-chart-predictions.ts`
- Uses Gemini AI to analyze historical market data
- Generates structured predictions:
  - Price predictions for next 30/60/90 days
  - Volume predictions
  - Market trend forecasts
  - Anomaly detection
  - Confidence scores for all predictions
- Saves predictions to database for chart consumption

#### Database: Migration 012_chart_predictions.sql
- New `chart_predictions` table with flexible JSONB structure
- Stores:
  - Model-specific predictions
  - Market-wide trends
  - Confidence and anomaly scores
  - Factors considered in predictions
- Includes views for recent and upcoming predictions
- Allows validation of predictions against actual values

#### API: `/api/predictions` endpoint
- Fetches AI predictions from database
- Formats data for chart consumption
- Returns structured data:
  - Price predictions with confidence
  - Volume predictions
  - Market trends
  - Anomaly alerts
- Includes metadata about prediction freshness

#### Component: `PredictionsChart.tsx`
- Visualizes historical data vs AI predictions
- Shows confidence levels as overlay
- Clear visual separation between actual and predicted
- Displays trend indicators and accuracy metrics
- AI-generated badge to indicate predictions

### 3. Workflow Updates
Updated `market-insights.yml` workflow to:
- Generate text-based insights (existing)
- **NEW:** Generate chart predictions using AI
- Runs daily at 6 AM UTC
- Weekly deep analysis on Mondays
- Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret in GitHub

## How It Works

1. **Daily Workflow** runs and:
   - Generates text market insights (existing)
   - Calls `generate-chart-predictions.ts` for AI predictions
   - Stores predictions in database

2. **AI Analysis Process**:
   - Fetches historical data from last 365 days
   - Aggregates into weekly/monthly patterns
   - Uses Gemini to predict future trends
   - Considers seasonality and market patterns
   - Generates confidence scores

3. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Fetches predictions via `/api/predictions`
   - Displays alongside real data
   - Shows prediction confidence
   - Updates automatically when new predictions generated

## Key Decisions

1. **Used Gemini AI** instead of OpenAI for predictions (already had Gemini setup)
2. **Structured data over text**: Created JSON predictions that charts can directly consume
3. **Confidence tracking**: Every prediction has a confidence score
4. **Validation capability**: Can compare predictions to actual values after the fact
5. **Separated concerns**: Predictions stored separately from actual data

## Important Issues Found

### Migration Numbering Problem
- Found duplicate migration numbers (two 004 files, two 010 files)
- New migration should have been 012, not 004
- Fixed by renaming to 012_chart_predictions.sql
- **TODO:** Should fix duplicate migrations to avoid conflicts

### Workflow Confusion
- Agent initially created a new scraper workflow when we wanted predictions
- We already have scrapers - needed AI analytics, not more scraping
- Removed unnecessary `comprehensive-scraper.yml`
- Focus should be on generating insights from existing data

## Testing the System

1. **Generate predictions manually**:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/analytics/generate-chart-predictions.ts --days=30 --force
```

2. **Check predictions in database**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM chart_predictions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

3. **Test API endpoint**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/predictions?days=30"
```

4. **View in dashboard**:
- Navigate to `/insights`
- Predictions will appear in charts if available

## Environment Variables Needed
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - For AI predictions (in GitHub secrets)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - For database access
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Public key

## Lessons Learned

1. **Real data is essential**: Dashboard was showing fake data with Math.random() - removed all of it
2. **Structured over unstructured**: AI should generate JSON data for charts, not just text insights
3. **Migration discipline**: Always check existing migrations before creating new ones
4. **Workflow clarity**: Be clear about what workflows do - scraping vs analytics vs predictions
5. **API design**: Filter by `sold_date` not `scraped_at` for accurate time-based analytics

## Next Steps

1. Add GEMINI_API_KEY to GitHub secrets
2. Run the workflow to generate initial predictions
3. Monitor prediction accuracy over time
4. Add more sophisticated prediction models
5. Fix duplicate migration numbers
6. Add prediction explanations to help users understand AI reasoning
