npx tsx scripts/scraping/scrape-and-save.ts --source=truecar
npx tsx scripts/scraping/scrape-and-save.ts --source=carfax
npx tsx scripts/scraping/scrape-and-save.ts --source=carmax
npx tsx scripts/scraping/scrape-and-save.ts --source=carvana

# Run with specific model and page limits
npx tsx scripts/scraping/scrape-and-save.ts --source=truecar --model=911 --max-pages=3
```

## Expected Data Volume Increase
