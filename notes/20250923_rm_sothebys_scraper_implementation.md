# September 23, 2025 - RM Sotheby's Scraper Implementation

## Overview

Successfully researched and implemented a comprehensive scraper for RM Sotheby's auction house to expand our Porsche sold listing sources. This adds a major high-end auction house to our data collection pipeline.

## Research Findings

### RM Sotheby's Analysis
- **URL Structure**: `https://rmsothebys.com/auctions/{code}/lots/{lot-id}/`
- **Search URL**: `https://rmsothebys.com/search?availability=sold&categories=motor-cars&make=porsche`
- **Data Quality**: Excellent - includes VIN, sold prices, comprehensive specifications
- **Technical Challenge**: Heavy JavaScript-based site requiring browser automation
- **Anti-Scraping**: reCAPTCHA and bot detection measures present

### Data Availability
✅ **Available:**
- VIN numbers in lot details
- Sold prices for completed auctions
- Comprehensive mileage data
- Auction dates
- Detailed specifications
- High-quality images
- Provenance information

❌ **Challenges:**
- Dynamic content loading via JavaScript
- Search results require browser automation
- Rate limiting needed to avoid detection
- Some data may require authentication

### Other Auction Houses Surveyed

**Bonhams**:
- Has sold car results but limited Porsche-specific data
- Standard HTML structure, easier to scrape
- Lower volume than RM Sotheby's

**Barrett-Jackson**:
- Good data availability but blocked during testing
- Would need further investigation

**Mecum**:
- Site inaccessible during testing
- May require different approach

**Collecting Cars**:
- Returned 403 errors, likely has strong anti-scraping

## Implementation

### Scraper Features
- **Extends BaseScraper**: Follows established patterns
- **Dual Strategy**: Curl first, fallback to Puppeteer for JavaScript-heavy pages
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect server resources
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive extraction and validation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and logging

### Key Components

1. **fetchUrl()**: Intelligent fetching with curl/Puppeteer fallback
2. **extractSearchResults()**: Finds Porsche sports cars from search pages
3. **scrapeDetail()**: Extracts all listing data from individual lot pages
4. **Data Extractors**: Specialized methods for VIN, price, mileage, etc.

### Data Fields Extracted
- VIN (Porsche format validation)
- Sold price and date
- Mileage with validation
- Year, model, trim detection
- Colors (exterior/interior)
- Transmission type
- Location
- Options/equipment
- Source ID for tracking

### Integration
- Added to main scraping pipeline in `scrape-and-save.ts`
- Positioned as scraper #4 of 7 in sold listings workflow
- Includes database integration and options processing
- Full HTML storage for future reference

## Testing Strategy

### Validation Approach
- Compile-time checks: ✅ Passed
- Porsche filtering: Validates sports cars only (no SUVs/sedans)
- Price validation: $15,000+ minimum to filter out parts/accessories
- VIN validation: Porsche-specific format (WP0/WP1)
- Mileage validation: Reasonable limits based on car age and type

### Safety Features
- Session caching to avoid duplicate requests
- Graceful fallbacks when data unavailable
- Comprehensive error logging
- Rate limiting (3+ seconds between requests)

## Usage

```bash
# Test Sotheby's scraper specifically
npx tsx scripts/scraping/scrape-and-save.ts --source=sothebys --max-pages=1

# Include in daily scraping
npx tsx scripts/scraping/scrape-and-save.ts --type=sold
```

## Expected Impact

### Data Volume
- **High-end segment**: RM Sotheby's specializes in rare, high-value Porsches
- **Complement existing data**: Fills gap in auction market coverage
- **Quality over quantity**: Fewer listings but higher-value and better documented

### Market Coverage
- **GT cars**: Excellent coverage of GT3, GT4, GT2 models
- **Special editions**: S/T, Sport Classic, PTS cars
- **Vintage models**: Classic 911s and rare variants
- **International sales**: Global auction results

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies
- Uses existing `CurlFetcher` for simple requests
- Uses existing `BrightDataPuppeteer` for JavaScript rendering
- Integrates with `HTMLStorageService` for archival
- Works with existing options processing pipeline

### Bright Data Requirements
- Needs `BRIGHT_DATA_CUSTOMER_ID` and `BRIGHT_DATA_BROWSER_PASSWORD`
- Falls back to curl-only mode if credentials unavailable
- May require occasional credential rotation

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Watch scraping success rates and data quality
2. **Tune Selectors**: Adjust HTML selectors based on real-world results
3. **Rate Limiting**: Optimize delays based on site behavior
4. **Authentication**: Consider if login improves data access
5. **Other Auction Houses**: Implement Bonhams if RM Sotheby's proves valuable

## Lessons Learned

1. **Research First**: Comprehensive site analysis prevented implementation issues
2. **Fallback Strategy**: Curl + Puppeteer approach handles various site architectures
3. **Data Quality**: Auction houses have excellent data but require careful extraction
4. **Anti-Scraping**: Major auction houses have sophisticated protection measures
5. **Value Focus**: High-end sources provide better data even with lower volume

## File Changes

- **Created**: `/lib/scrapers/sothebys.ts` - Main scraper implementation
- **Modified**: `/scripts/scraping/scrape-and-save.ts` - Added to scraping pipeline
- **Updated**: Source lists and configuration throughout codebase

This implementation significantly expands our auction market coverage and should provide high-quality data for the premium Porsche segment.
